Develop a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) strategy
# Develop an actionable alerting strategy
• identify and recommend metrics on which to base alerts
• implement alerts using appropriate metrics
• implement alerts based on appropriate log messages
• implement alerts based on application health checks
• analyze combinations of metrics
• develop communication mechanism to notify users of degraded systems
• implement alerts for self-healing activities (e.g. scaling, failovers)
# Design a failure prediction strategy
• analyze behavior of system with regards to load and failure conditions
• calculate when a system will fail under various conditions
• measure baseline metrics for system
• recommend the appropriate tools for a failure prediction strategy
# Design and implement a health check
• analyze system dependencies to determine which dependency should be included in health check
• calculate healthy response timeouts based on SLO for the service
• design approach for partial health situations
• integrate health check with compute environment
• implement different types of health checks (liveness, startup, shutdown)
