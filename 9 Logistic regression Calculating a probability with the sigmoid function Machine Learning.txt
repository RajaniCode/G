A logistic regression model with three features has the following bias and weights

b = 1

w1 = 2

w2 = -1

w3 = 5

Given the following input values

x1 = 0

x2 = 10

x3 = 2

1. What is the value of z for these input values?

2. What is the logistic regression prediction for these input values?


Answer
1. The value of  z is 1.
[
The linear equation defined by the weights and bias is z = 1 + 2x1 â€“ x2 + 5x3. Plugging the input values into the equation produces z = 1 + (2)(0) - (10) + (5)(2) = 1
]

2. The logistic regression prediction is approximately 0.731.
[
As calculated in #1 above, the log-odds for the input values is 1. Plugging that value for z into the sigmoid function
y = 1 / (1 + (e ^ - z)) = 1 / (1 + (e ^ - 1)) = 1 / (1 + 0.367) = 1 / (1.367) = 0.7315289
]

NB
1. Compute the linear combination z using the formula
z = b + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3

Given
b = 1
w1 = 2, w2 = -1, w3 = 5
x1 = 0, x2 = 10, x3 = 2

Plug in
z = 1 + (2 * 0) + (-1 * 10) + (5 * 2) = 1 + 0 - 10 + 10 = 1

2. Compute the logistic (sigmoid) prediction
y = sigma(z) = 1 / (1 + (e ^ - z))
with z = 1, this becomes
y = 1 / (1 + (e ^ - 1)) = 0.73105858
