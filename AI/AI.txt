# 1. Introduction to Generative AI
1. What is a prompt?
A prompt is a short piece of text that is given to the large language model as input, and it can be used to control the output of the model in many ways.

2. Hallucinations are words or phrases that are generated by the model that are often nonsensical or grammatically incorrect. What are some factors that can cause hallucinations? Select three options.
The model is not trained on enough data.
The model is trained on noisy or dirty data.
The model is not given enough context.

3. What are foundation models in Generative AI?
A foundation model is a large AI model pretrained on a vast quantity of data that was "designed to be adapted” (or fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and object recognition.

4. What is an example of both a generative AI model and a discriminative AI model?
A generative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and then used to generate new images of cats. A discriminative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and dogs and then used to classify new images as either cats or dogs.

5. What is Generative AI?:
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, and video.


# 2. Introduction to Large Language Models: Quiz
1. What are large language models (LLMs)?
An LLM is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate human-quality text. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and they can be used for many tasks, such as writing, translating, and coding.

2. What are some of the applications of LLMs?
LLMs can be used for many tasks, including writing, translating, and coding.

3. What are some of the challenges of using LLMs? Select three options
They can be used to generate harmful content.
They can be expensive to train.
They can be biased.

4. What is a benefit of using large language models (LLMs)?
They can generate human-quality text for tasks such as content creation, writing assistance, and automatic summarization.


# 3. Introduction to Responsible AI: Quiz
1. Organizations are developing their own AI principles that reflect their mission and values. What are the common themes among these principles?
A consistent set of ideas about transparency, fairness, accountability, and privacy.

2. Which of the below is one of Google’s 7 AI principles?
AI should uphold high standards of scientific excellence.


3. Why is responsible AI practice important to an organization?
Responsible AI practice can help build trust with customers and stakeholders.

4. Which of these is correct with regard to applying responsible AI practices?
Decisions made at all stages in a project make an impact on responsible AI.
